# Google-Scripts-Automation
This JS function was adapted from a script I use to connect Google Forms, Google Sheets, and Gmail. 

The goal of the original script is to automate the collection of student's tutorial replacement requests.  
The function has 2 stages:
<ol>
  <li>Collect all students' requests and send emails based on outcome.</li>
  <li>Compile all their details and group them by outcome before sending the compiled list to all team members</li>
</ol>

This simple script saves the team a lot of time and reduces the risk of human errors. 
 
The script in this repo uses a similar logic to communicate final results to dummy students.
